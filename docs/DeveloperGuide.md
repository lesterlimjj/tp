## **Acknowledgements**

This project is **based on the AddressBook-Level3 project** created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

Generative AI tools such as chatgpt and GitHub Copilot were selectively used to support the development process, specifically for:
* Drafting and refining JUnit test cases
* Enhancing JavaDoc clarity

The main implementation and logic were independently developed and verified by the project team.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletePerson 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a MainWindow that is made up of several parts:
- Command Interface: CommandBox, ResultDisplay
- List Panels:
    - `PersonListPanel` with `PersonCard` and `PreferenceListPanel` with `PreferenceCard`
    - `ListingListPanel` with `ListingCard` and `OwnerListPanel` with `OwnerCard`
    - `TagListPanel` 
- Utility Components: `HelpWindow`, `StatusBarFooter`

All these components, including the `MainWindow`, `inherit` from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("deletePerson 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeletePersonSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletePerson 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeletePersonCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeletePersonCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

**Note:** The attributes of `Person`, `Tag`, `PriceRange` that have been promoted to a class are abstracted into separate class diagrams for ease of reading.

The `Model` component,

* stores the match estate data composed of `Person`, `PropertyPreference`,  `Listing` and `Tag` and `PriceRange` objects.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `PropertyPreference` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<PropertyPreference>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Listing` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Listing>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Tag` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ set which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tag>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

`Person`

<puml src="diagrams/PersonAttributesClassDiagram.puml" width="350" />

* Stores person-related data as `Person` objects contained in a `UniquePersonList` object.
* Each `Person` may have multiple`PropertyPreference` and `Listing` associations.
* Each `Person` is identified their phone number.



`PropertyPreference`

* Each `PropertyPreference` may have a `PriceRange`, and multiple `Tag` associations.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** A `PropertyPreference` can only be tied to 1 `Person` to group criterias for a property that they are looking for, under a representative person responsible for the purchase.

</box>

`Listing`

<puml src="diagrams/ListingAttributesClassDiagram.puml" width="350" />

* Stores listing-related data as `Listing` objects contained in a `UniqueListingList` object.
* Each `Listing` may have a `PriceRange`, and multiple `Tag`  and `Owner` associations.
* Each `Listing` should have either a `Unit Number` or a `House Number` but not both.
* Each `Listing` is identified by a combination of the `Postal Code` and either the `Unit Number` or the `House Number` depending on which one is present.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** A `Listing` can have multiple `Person` to reflect co-ownership scenarios. Additionally in certain cases joint approval of a listing is required for a purchase.

</box>

`PriceRange`

<puml src="diagrams/PriceRangeAttributesClassDiagram.puml" width="350" />

* Each `PriceRange` may have a lower bound price and a upper bound price.
* If neither bound is specified, the `PriceRange` is unbounded.

`Tag`
* Stores tag-related data as `Tag` objects contained in a `TagRegistry` object.
* Each `Tag` may have multiple `Listing`  and `PropertyPreference` associations.
* Each `Tag` is identified by a string tag name.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An possible alternative representation of Tag is to split the tag that stores the association from the tag name, promoting the tag name into a class.

<puml src="diagrams/BetterTagAttributesClassDiagram.puml" width="350" />

</box>

`SearchContext` and `SearchType`
* SearchContext represents the current active filters for Tags, PriceRange, and PropertyPreference.
* SearchType enumeration represents the types (Person/ Listing) of searches that can be performed.

**Bidirectional navigability:**

`Listing` and `Person`:
- Listings require references to their owners to display on the UI.
- Listings uses reference to the owners to ensure that when matching, owners of a listing are not matched to them.
- Person uses reference to the listings to ensure that they should have a `seller` display label. Alternatively a counter could also be used, however a direct reference would better ensure correctness.
- Person uses references to the listings to ensure cascading deletion of a person also removes the person as a owner from their listings. Searching through all listings to maintain the cascading delete would be inefficient.

`Person` and `PropertyPreference`:
- Person requires references to their preferences to display on the UI.
- Preferences requires references to their owner, such that when a tag is removed from the preference (by cascading deletion of a tag). The person the preference belongs to can update the display on the UI.
- Preferences uses references to their owner to ensure cascading deletion of a preference also removes the preference from their owner without needing to search all persons which is especially inefficient since a preference can only have 1 owner.

`Listing` and `Tags`:
- Listing requires references to tags to display on the UI.
- Tags uses references to the listing to ensure that they have an accurate instance usage label. Alternatively a counter could also be used, however a direct reference would better ensure correctness.
- Tags uses references to their listing to ensure cascading deletion of a tag also removes the tag from the listings that uses it. Searching through all listings, would be inefficient.

`PropertyPreference` and `Tags`:
- Property preferences requires references to tags to display on the UI.
- Tags uses references to the property preferences to ensure that they have an accurate instance usage label. Alternatively a counter could also be used, however a direct reference would better ensure correctness.
- Tags uses references to their property preferences to ensure cascading deletion of a tag also removes the tag from the property preferences that uses it. Searching through all preferences, would be inefficient.

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* stores match estate data and user preferences locally on disk in JSON format, and reads them back into the model when needed.
* is defined by the `Storage` interface, which inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`.
  This allows it to be used for storing either address book data or user preferences independently.
* is implemented by `StorageManager`, which delegates to:
  * `JsonAddressBookStorage` — handles storage and retrieval of address book data.
  * `JsonUserPrefsStorage` — handles storage and retrieval of user preferences.
* uses `JsonSerializableAddressBook` as the top-level serializable container to read/write the full address book.
* relies on Jackson-compatible intermediary classes (e.g. `JsonAdaptedPerson`, `JsonAdaptedListing`, `JsonAdaptedTag`,
  `JsonAdaptedPreference`, and `JsonAdaptedPriceRange`) to convert between JSON and model types.
* depends on model classes such as `ReadOnlyAddressBook` and `UserPrefs`, as it handles the persistence of these entities.

**Note:**  
In `JsonAdaptedListing`, the `ownerKeys` field contains phone numbers as strings.  
These are used to look up the corresponding `Person` objects during deserialization — forming an indirect association from `Listing` to `Person`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Planned Implementation**

This section describes how certain proposed features are to be implemented in future iterations.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Edit tag command

The edit tag command allows users to edit the name of an existing tag. This command is useful when users want to change the name of a tag that they have already created. The following sequence diagram shows how the edit tag command works:

<puml src="diagrams/EditTagSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditTagSequenceDiagram" />

The associated Listings and PropertyPreferences will be updated to reflect the new tag name.

### \[Proposed\] Edit listing command

The edit listing command allows users to edit the details of an existing listing. This command is useful when users want to update information such as postal code, unit/house number, price range, or property name of a listing. The following sequence diagram shows how the edit listing command works:

<puml src="diagrams/EditListingSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="EditListingSequenceDiagram" />

The edit operation will update the listing's details while maintaining its existing tags, owners and availability status. The system can ensure that no duplicate listings can be created through this command by checking the postal code and unit/house number combination.

### \[Proposed\] Merge tag command
The merge tag command allows users to merge an existing tag into another existing tag. This command is useful when users want to merge two similarly named tags. One consideration is to subsume this proposal into the proposed edit tag command, however this results in the possibility of users accidentally merging two distinct tags, when they intended to rename if a tag does not exist. The following sequence diagram shows how the merge tag command works:

<puml src="diagrams/MergeTagSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="MergeTagSequenceDiagram" />

The associated Listings and PropertyPreferences from the tag that was merged from will also be merged into the other existing tag.

## Enhancements still in consideration:
These are features still in consideration about whether to be implemented.

### \[Consideration\] Clear confirmation

#### Design considerations:

**Issue:** Users who are unfamiliar with the command may accidentally delete all their data, as the current clear command deletes everything without any confirmation.

* **Current implementation:** Clear without confirmation.
  * Pros: Fulfils project’s recommendation for one shot commands.
  * Cons: Users unfamiliar with the command may accidentally delete their data.

* **Alternative 1:** Clear with confirmation window pop-up.
  * Pros: Users are warned that the command deletes all data.
  * Cons: Violates project’s “typing preferred” constraint.

* **Alternative 2:** Clear with confirmation command.
  * Pros: Users are warned through the command response that the command deletes all data.
  * Cons:  Does not fulfill project’s recommendation for one shot commands. Hard to implement as it subverts the current `logic` sequence diagram by having multiple commands that need to be created and executed.

### \[Consideration\] Command word length

#### Design considerations:

**Issue:** Experienced users may prefer shorter command words. However, there are multiple variations for shorthands for a word, for example `Preference` has the common shorthand of `Pref`, `Pf` and `Pfr`. Thus, using shorthands across the current number of commands may increase the initial learning curve of the application.

* **Current implementation:** Commands not using shorthands.
  * Pros: Easy for new users to pick up. Intention of the command is clear.
  * Cons: Can be quite lengthy to type.

* **Alternative 1:** Commands using shorthands.
  * Pros: Faster to type.
  * Cons: Harder for new users to pick up.

* **Alternative 2:** Rename command.
  * Pros: Gives the users an option to modify the command words as they see fit to something easier for them to remember. Commands can still match the dynamically generated help window.
  * Cons: Returning users may struggle to relearn the commands as it will no longer match the user guide.

### \[Consideration\] Space separated search person keyword

#### Design considerations:

**Issue:** Users may intend to search by a space separated keyword “Alex Yeoh” instead of 2 keywords “Alex” and “Yeoh”.

* **Current implementation:** Keywords do not include space.
  * Pros: Allows users to specify multiple keywords at once.
  * Cons: Prevents users from searching by space separated keywords.

* **Alternative 1:** Keyword includes space.
  * Pros: Allows users from searching by space separated keywords.
  * Cons: Prevents users from specifying multiple keywords.

* **Alternative 2:** New command format of `searchPersonName n/Name…`, for example `searchPersonName n/Alex Yeoh n/John Doe`
  * Pros: Allows users to specify multiple space separated names at once. Prefix tag of `n/` might be more appropriate for such a command.
  * Cons: Requires significant changes from AB3 legacy code.

### \[Consideration\] Applying multiple search/match filters concurrently

#### Design considerations:

**Issue:** Users may intend to search person by name and then search person by tags concurrently.

* **Current implementation:** Search overwrites other filters.
  * Pros: Easy to implement. Reduces need to list all before applying a new search on all items.
  * Cons: Prevents users from filtering by multiple parameters.

* **Alternative 1:** New search does not overwrite previous filters.
  * Pros: Allows users more control over filtering
  * Cons: Hard to implement. Creates complex predicates. Requires listing all to apply a new search on all items.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

### Target User Profile:

**Profile**
Tim is a busy, independent real estate agent working in Singapore, managing multiple buyers and sellers simultaneously.

He often communicates with clients through messaging applications and understands their preferences and specifications from chat logs. During client meetups, open houses, and property tours, he may also take notes on common likes and dislikes among clients.

He records these details in an Excel sheet on his laptop, sometimes on the fly, and is highly experienced in fast typing.

Tim has noticed that many client requests can be matched with specific listings he has, but manually filtering and matching these requests with listings can be cumbersome.

**Work Patterns**

- Primarily works alone but may collaborate with other agents to gain information on additional listings, so he needs to send and receive listing and client information easily.
- Commonly works with clients, many of whom have preferences that overlap with those of other clients.
- Uses both a laptop and a smartphone for work.
- Prefers typing and, by extension, CLI tools for speed and efficiency, as he frequently needs to quickly note down client preferences.
- Regularly shares the tools he uses with other agents he is familiar with.
- Struggles to manage client details across messaging apps and spreadsheets.
- Needs to match buyers with sellers quickly and accurately.
- Works on the go, handling leads from different sources.
- Wants to keep client contacts separate from personal contacts for **PDPA** compliance.
- Prefers offline tools due to security concerns regarding potential customer data leaks.
- Also favors offline tools due to the possibility of an unstable internet connection.
- Does not use **CRM** or organizational tools, as they are beyond his job scope as an independent real estate agent.

### Value Proposition:
Real estate agents often struggle to manage buyers and sellers through messaging apps.
MatchEstate allows tracking of buyers and sellers easily as well as their preferences and offerings respectively.
It enables fast matching of buyers and sellers. It is tailored for those who prefer CLIs.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to support at least 500 buyers and 500 sellers without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  Should provide informative error messages for invalid commands or input.
4.  Should be easily extensible by future developers with minimal breaking changes.
5.  Should be distributable as a .jar file that runs without external setup beyond Java `17`.
6.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
7.  The user interface should be intuitive enough that non-tech savvy users can use it.
8.  The application should respond to all user commands within 2 seconds under typical conditions.
9.  All data changes should be automatically saved to prevent data loss in the event of an application crash or closure.
10.  The application should fail gracefully in most cases. However, as the application is intended for a single offline user, malicious manipulations of the data file is not an anticipated behaviour. Therefore, handling corrupted data files is a ‘good to have’ and not in scope.
