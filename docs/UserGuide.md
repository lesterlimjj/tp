# MatchEstate User Guide

**MatchEstate** is a desktop application tailored for **real estate agents** to efficiently manage their clients ‚Äî whether they are buyers, sellers, or both. MatchEstate enables fast matching of buyers to suitable listings and vice versa. While it features a graphical interface, the app is optimized for users who prefer fast keyboard-based interactions using a Command Line Interface (CLI).

MatchEstate classifies contacts into two main roles:

**Buyers** are clients looking to purchase a property. They typically have a set of criteria such as budget, location, property type (e.g., HDB, Condo), or features like ‚Äúnear MRT‚Äù or ‚Äúnear schools‚Äù.
- These are captured in property preferences ‚Äî each containing a price range and a list of tags representing specific requirements.
- A buyer can have multiple preferences, as they may be looking to purchase more than one property.


**Sellers** are clients looking to list properties for sale.
- Each listing contains essential property details such as postal code, unit number as well as the asking price, and a set of tags to describe its specifications for matching.
- To associate a listing with a seller, agents can simply add the listing to a person, establishing ownership.

#### Automatic Classification:
MatchEstate automatically classifies people based on their data:
- A person is a buyer if they have at least one property preference.
- A person is a seller if they have at least one listing.

üí° A person can be both a buyer and a seller in the system.

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2103-F08-3/tp/releases/tag/v1.6).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in brackets are mutually exclusive.<br>
  e.g. `pc/POSTAL_CODE (u/UNIT_NUMBER)(h/HOUSE_NUMBER)` can be used as `pc/654321 u/12-111` or as `pc/654321 h/12` but not both.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times but at least one time.<br>
  e.g. `t/TAG‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items in square brackets with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Items in square brackets with a {num} after them, groups 2 or more prefixes in the command which requires at least 1 prefix from the group to be present.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]{1}... [nt/NEW_TAG]{1}...` can be used as `nt/friend`, `t/family`, `t/family nt/friend` but not ` `(no parameter specified).

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MatchEstate home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
